    "## Roots\n",
    "\n",
    "Although deep learning is a recent invention, humans have held the desire to analyze data and to predict future outcomes for centuries. In fact, much of natural science has its roots in this. For instance, the Bernoulli distribution is named after [Jacob Bernoulli (1655-1705)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Bernoulli), and the Gaussian distribution was discovered by [Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss). He invented for instance the least mean squares algorithm, which is still used today for a range of problems from insurance calculations to medical diagnostics. These tools gave rise to an experimental approach in natural sciences - for instance, Ohm's law relating current and voltage in a resistor is perfectly described by a linear model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even in the middle ages mathematicians had a keen intuition of estimates. For instance, the geometry book of [Jacob Köbel (1460-1533)](https://www.maa.org/press/periodicals/convergence/mathematical-treasures-jacob-kobels-geometry) illustrates averaging the length of 16 adult men's feet to obtain the average foot length.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Estimating the length of a foot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d2l-ai/notebooks/master/img/koebel.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 1.1 illustrates how this estimator works. 16 adult men were asked to line up in a row, when leaving church. Their aggregate length was then divided by 16 to obtain an estimate for what now amounts to 1 foot. This 'algorithm' was later improved to deal with misshapen feet - the 2 men with the shortest and longest feet respectively were sent away, averaging only over the remainder. This is one of the earliest examples of the trimmed mean estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistics really took off with the collection and availability of data. One of its titans, [Ronald Fisher (1890-1962)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher), contributed significantly to its theory and also its applications in genetics. Many of his algorithms (such as Linear Discriminant Analysis) and formulae (such as the Fisher Information Matrix) are still in frequent use today (even the Iris dataset that he released in 1936 is still used sometimes to illustrate machine learning algorithms).\n",
    "\n",
    "A second influence for machine learning came from Information Theory [(Claude Shannon, 1916-2001)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon) and the Theory of computation via [Alan Turing (1912-1954)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing). Turing posed the question \"can machines think?” in his famous paper [Computing machinery and intelligence](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2251299) (Mind, October 1950). In what he described as the Turing test, a machine can be considered intelligent if it is difficult for a human evaluator to distinguish between the replies from a machine and a human being through textual interactions. To this day, the development of intelligent machines is changing rapidly and continuously.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another influence can be found in neuroscience and psychology. After all, humans clearly exhibit intelligent behavior. It is thus only reasonable to ask whether one could explain and possibly reverse engineer these insights. One of the oldest algorithms to accomplish this was formulated by [Donald Hebb (1904-1985)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_O._Hebb).\n",
    "\n",
    "In his groundbreaking book [The Organization of Behavior](http://s-f-walker.org.uk/pubsebooks/pdfs/The_Organization_of_Behavior-Donald_O._Hebb.pdf) (John Wiley & Sons, 1949) he posited that neurons learn by positive reinforcement. This became known as the Hebbian learning rule. It is the prototype of Rosenblatt's perceptron learning algorithm and it laid the foundations of many stochastic gradient descent algorithms that underpin deep learning today: reinforce desirable behavior and diminish undesirable behavior to obtain good weights in a neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Biological inspiration is what gave Neural Networks its name. For over a century (dating back to the models of Alexander Bain, 1873 and James Sherrington, 1890) researchers have tried to assemble computational circuits that resemble networks of interacting neurons. Over time the interpretation of biology became more loose but the name stuck. At its heart lie a few key principles that can be found in most networks today:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The alternation of linear and nonlinear processing units, often referred to as 'layers'.\n",
    "* The use of the chain rule (aka backpropagation) for adjusting parameters in the entire network at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "After initial rapid progress, research in Neural Networks languished from around 1995 until 2005. This was due to a number of reasons. Training a network is computationally very expensive. While RAM was plentiful at the end of the past century, computational power was scarce. Secondly, datasets were relatively small. In fact, Fisher's 'Iris dataset' from 1932 was a popular tool for testing the efficacy of algorithms. MNIST with its 60,000 handwritten digits was considered huge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the scarcity of data and computation, strong statistical tools such as Kernel Methods, Decision Trees and Graphical Models proved empirically superior. Unlike Neural Networks they did not require weeks to train and provided predictable results with strong theoretical guarantees.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Road to Deep Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Much of this changed with the ready availability of large amounts of data, due to the World Wide Web, the advent of companies serving hundreds of millions of users online, a dissemination of cheap, high quality sensors, cheap data storage (Kryder's law), and cheap computation (Moore's law), in particular in the form of GPUs, originally engineered for computer gaming. Suddenly algorithms and models that seemed computationally infeasible became relevant (and vice versa). This is best illustrated in the table below:\n",
    "\n",
    "|Decade|Dataset|Memory|Floating Point Calculations per Second|\n",
    "|:--|:-|:-|:-|\n",
    "|1970|100 (Iris)|1 KB|100 KF (Intel 8080)|\n",
    "|1980|1 K (House prices in Boston)|100 KB|1 MF (Intel 80186)|\n",
    "|1990|10 K (optical character recognition)|10 MB|10 MF (Intel 80486)|\n",
    "|2000|10 M (web pages)|100 MB|1 GF (Intel Core)|\n",
    "|2010|10 G (advertising)|1 GB|1 TF (Nvidia C2050)|\n",
    "|2020|1 T (social network)|100 GB|1 PF (Nvidia DGX-2)|\n",
    "\n",
    "It is quite evident that RAM has not kept pace with the growth in data. At the same time, the increase in computational power has outpaced that of the data available. This means that statistical models needed to become more memory efficient (this is typically achieved by adding nonlinearities) while simultaneously being able to spend more time on optimizing these parameters, due to an increased compute budget. Consequently the sweet spot in machine learning and statistics moved from (generalized) linear models and kernel methods to deep networks. This is also one of the reasons why many of the mainstays of deep learning, such as Multilayer Perceptrons (e.g. McCulloch & Pitts, 1943), Convolutional Neural Networks (Le Cun, 1992), Long Short Term Memory (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997), Q-Learning (Watkins, 1989), were essentially 'rediscovered' in the past decade, after laying dormant for considerable time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The recent progress in statistical models, applications, and algorithms, has sometimes been likened to the Cambrian Explosion: a moment of rapid progress in the evolution of species. Indeed, the state of the art is not just a mere consequence of available resources, applied to decades old algorithms. Note that the list below barely scratches the surface of the ideas that have helped researchers achieve tremendous progress over the past decade.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Novel methods for capacity control, such as Dropout [3] allowed for training of relatively large networks without the danger of overfitting, i.e. without the danger of merely memorizing large parts of the training data. This was achieved by applying noise injection [4] throughout the network, replacing weights by random variables for training purposes.\n",
    "* Attention mechanisms solved a second problem that had plagued statistics for over a century: how to increase the memory and complexity of a system without increasing the number of learnable parameters. [5] found an elegant solution by using what can only be viewed as a learnable pointer structure. That is, rather than having to remember an entire sentence, e.g. for machine translation in a fixed-dimensional representation, all that needed to be stored was a pointer to the intermediate state of the translation process. This allowed for significantly increased accuracy for long sentences, since the model no longer needed to remember the entire sentence before beginning to generate sentences.\n",
    "* Multi-stage designs, e.g. via the Memory Networks [6] and the Neural Programmer-Interpreter [7] allowed statistical modelers to describe iterative approaches to reasoning. These tools allow for an internal state of the deep network to be modified repeatedly, thus carrying out subsequent steps in a chain of reasoning, similar to how a processor can modify memory for a computation.\n",
    "* Another key development was the invention of Generative Adversarial Networks [8]. Traditionally statistical methods for density estimation and generative models focused on finding proper probability distributions and (often approximate) algorithms for sampling from them. As a result, these algorithms were largely limited by the lack of flexibility inherent in the statistical models. The crucial innovation in GANs was to replace the sampler by an arbitrary algorithm with differentiable parameters. These are then adjusted in such a way that the discriminator (effectively a two-sample test) cannot distinguish fake from real data. Through the ability to use arbitrary algorithms to generate data it opened up density estimation to a wide variety of techniques. Examples of galloping Zebras [9] and of fake celebrity faces [10] are both testimony to this progress.\n",
    "* In many cases a single GPU is insufficient to process the large amounts of data available for training. Over the past decade the ability to build parallel distributed training algorithms has improved significantly. One of the key challenges in designing scalable algorithms is that the workhorse of deep learning optimization, stochastic gradient descent, relies on relatively small minibatches of data to be processed. At the same time, small batches limit the efficiency of GPUs. Hence, training on 1024 GPUs with a minibatch size of, say 32 images per batch amounts to an aggregate minibatch of 32k images. Recent work, first by Li [11],  and subsequently by You et al. [12] and Jia et al. [13] pushed the size up to 64k observations, reducing training time for ResNet50 on ImageNet to less than 7 minutes. For comparison - initially training times were measured in the order of days.\n",
    "* The ability to parallelize computation has also contributed quite crucially to progress in reinforcement learning, at least whenever simulation is an option. This has led to significant progress in computers achieving superhuman performance in Go, Atari games, Starcraft, and in physics simulations (e.g. using MuJoCo). See e.g. Silver et al. [18] for a description of how to achieve this in AlphaGo. In a nutshell, reinforcement learning works best if plenty of (state, action, reward) triples are available, i.e. whenever it is possible to try out lots of things to learn how they relate to each other. Simulation provides such an avenue.\n",
    "* Deep Learning frameworks have played a crucial role in disseminating ideas. The first generation of frameworks allowing for easy modeling encompassed [Caffe](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe), [Torch](https://github.com/torch), and [Theano](https://github.com/Theano/Theano). Many seminal papers were written using these tools. By now they have been superseded by [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow), often used via its high level API [Keras](https://github.com/keras-team/keras), [CNTK](https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK), [Caffe 2](https://github.com/caffe2/caffe2), and [Apache MxNet](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet). The third generation of tools, namely imperative tools for deep learning, was arguably spearheaded by [Chainer](https://github.com/chainer/chainer), which used a syntax similar to Python NumPy to describe models. This idea was adopted by [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch) and the [Gluon API](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet) of MxNet. It is the latter that this course uses to teach Deep Learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "The division of labor between systems researchers building better tools for training and statistical modelers building better networks has greatly simplified things. For instance, training a linear logistic regression model used to be a nontrivial homework problem, worthy to give to new Machine Learning PhD students at Carnegie Mellon University in 2014. By now, this task can be accomplished with less than 10 lines of code, putting it firmly into the grasp of programmers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Success Stories\n",
    "\n",
    "Artificial Intelligence has a long history of delivering results that would be difficult to accomplish otherwise. For instance, mail is sorted using optical character recognition. These systems have been deployed since the 90s (this is, after all, the source of the famous MNIST and USPS sets of handwritten digits). The same applies to reading checks for bank deposits and scoring creditworthiness of applicants. Financial transactions are checked for fraud automatically. This forms the backbone of many e-commerce payment systems, such as PayPal, Stripe, AliPay, WeChat, Apple, Visa, MasterCard. Computer programs for chess have been competitive for decades. Machine learning feeds search, recommendation, personalization and ranking on the internet. In other words, artificial intelligence and machine learning are pervasive, albeit often hidden from sight.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is only recently that AI has been in the limelight, mostly due to solutions to problems that were considered intractable previously.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Intelligent assistants, such as Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa, or Google's assistant are able to answer spoken questions with a reasonable degree of accuracy. This includes menial tasks such as turning on light switches (a boon to the disabled) up to making barber's appointments and offering phone support dialog. This is likely the most noticeable sign that AI is affecting our lives.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A key ingredient in digital assistants is the ability to recognize speech accurately. Gradually the accuracy of such systems has increased to the point where they reach human parity [14] for certain applications.\n",
    "* Object recognition likewise has come a long way. Estimating the object in a picture was a fairly challenging task in 2010. On the ImageNet benchmark Lin et al. [15] achieved a top-5 error rate of 28%. By 2017 Hu et al. [16] reduced this error rate to 2.25%. Similarly stunning results have been achieved for identifying birds, or diagnosing skin cancer.\n",
    "* Games used to be a bastion of human intelligence. Starting from TDGammon [23], a program for playing Backgammon using temporal difference (TD) reinforcement learning, algorithmic and computational progress has led to algorithms for a wide range of applications. Unlike Backgammon, chess has a much more complex state space and set of actions. DeepBlue beat Gary Kasparov, Campbell et al. [17], using massive parallelism, special purpose hardware and efficient search through the game tree. Go is more difficult still, due to its huge state space. AlphaGo reached human parity in 2015,  Silver et al. [18] using Deep Learning combined with Monte Carlo tree sampling. The challenge in Poker was that the state space is large and it is not fully observed (we don't know the opponents' cards). Libratus exceeded human performance in Poker using efficiently structured strategies; Brown and Sandholm [19]. This illustrates the impressive progress in games and the fact that advanced algorithms played a crucial part in them.\n",
    "* Another indication of progress in AI is the advent of self-driving cars and trucks. While full autonomy is not quite within reach yet, excellent progress has been made in this direction, with companies such as [Momenta](https://www.momenta.ai/en), [Tesla](http://www.tesla.com), [NVIDIA](http://www.nvidia.com), [MobilEye](http://www.mobileye.com) and [Waymo](http://www.waymo.com) shipping products that enable at least partial autonomy. What makes full autonomy so challenging is that proper driving requires the ability to perceive, to reason and to incorporate rules into a system. At present, Deep Learning is used primarily in the computer vision aspect of these problems. The rest is heavily tuned by engineers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, the above list barely scratches the surface of what is considered intelligent and where machine learning has led to impressive progress in a field. For instance, robotics, logistics, computational biology, particle physics and astronomy owe some of their most impressive recent advances at least in parts to machine learning. ML is thus becoming a ubiquitous tool for engineers and scientists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Frequently the question of the AI apocalypse, or the AI singularity has been raised in non-technical articles on AI. The fear is that somehow machine learning systems will become sentient and decide independently from their programmers (and masters) about things that directly affect the livelihood of humans. To some extent AI already affects the livelihood of humans in an immediate way - creditworthiness is assessed automatically, autopilots mostly navigate cars safely, decisions about whether to grant bail use statistical data as input. More frivolously, we can ask Alexa to switch on the coffee machine and she will happily oblige, provided that the appliance is internet enabled.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately we are far from a sentient AI system that is ready to enslave its human creators (or burn their coffee). Firstly, AI systems are engineered, trained and deployed in a specific, goal oriented manner. While their behavior might give the illusion of general intelligence, it is a combination of rules, heuristics and statistical models that underlie the design. Second, at present tools for general Artificial Intelligence simply do not exist that are able to improve themselves, reason about themselves, and that are able to modify, extend and improve their own architecture while trying to solve general tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "A much more realistic concern is how AI is being used in our daily lives. It is likely that many menial tasks fulfilled by truck drivers and shop assistants can and will be automated. Farm robots will likely reduce the cost for organic farming but they will also automate harvesting operations. This phase of the industrial revolution will have profound consequences on large swaths of society (truck drivers and shop assistants are some of the most common jobs in many states). Furthermore, statistical models, when applied without care can lead to racial, gender or age bias. It is important to ensure that these algorithms are used with great care. This is a much bigger concern than to worry about a potentially malevolent superintelligence intent on destroying humanity."
