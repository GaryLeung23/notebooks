    "# Optimization and Deep Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will discuss the relationship between optimization and deep learning as well as the challenges of using optimization in deep learning. For a deep learning problem, we will usually define a loss function first. Once we have the loss function, we can use an optimization algorithm in attempt to minimize the loss. In optimization, a loss function is often referred to as the objective function of the optimization problem. By tradition and convention most optimization algorithms are concerned with *minimization*. If we ever need to maximize an objective there's a simple solution - just flip the sign on the objective. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Optimization and Estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "Although optimization provides a way to minimize the loss function for deep learning, in essence, the goals of optimization and deep learning are fundamentally different. The former is primarily concerned with minimizing an objective whereas the latter is concerned with finding a suitable model, given a finite amount of data. \n",
    "In the section on [\"Model Selection, Underfitting and Overfitting\"](../chapter_deep-learning-basics/underfit-overfit.md) we discussed the difference between these two goals in detail. For instance, training error and generalization error generally differ: since the objective function of the optimization algorithm is usually a loss function based on the training data set, the goal of optimization is to reduce the training error.\n",
    "However, the goal of statistical inference (and thus of deep learning) is to reduce the generalization error.\n",
    "To accomplish the latter we need to pay attention to overfitting in addition to using the optimization algorithm to reduce the training error. We begin by importing a few libraries."

    "In the section on [Linear Regression](../chapter_deep-learning-basics/linear-regression.md) we distinguished between analytical solutions and numerical solutions in optimization problems. In deep learning, most objective functions are complicated and do not have analytical solutions. Instead, we must use numerical optimization algorithms. The optimization algorithms below all fall into this category. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many challenges in deep learning optimization. Some of the most vexing ones are local minima, saddle points and vanishing gradients. Let's have a look at a few of them. \n",

    "For the objective function $f(x)$, if the value of $f(x)$ at $x$ is smaller than the values of $f(x)$ at any other points in the vicinity of $x$, then $f(x)$ could be a local minimum. If the value of $f(x)$ at $x$ is the minimum of the objective function over the entire domain, then $f(x)$ is the global minimum.\n",

    "The objective function of deep learning models usually has many local optima. When the numerical solution of an optimization problem is near the local optimum, the numerical solution obtained by the final iteration may only minimize the objective function locally, rather than globally, as the gradient of the objective function's solutions approaches or becomes zero. Only some degree of noise might knock the parameter out of the local minimum. In fact, this is one of the beneficial properties of stochastic gradient descent where the natural variation of gradients over minibatches is able to dislodge the parameters from local minima.\n",

    "### Saddle Points\n",

    "Besides local minima, saddle points are another reason for gradients to vanish. A [saddle point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddle_point) is any location where all gradients of a function vanish but which is neither a global nor a local minimum. Consider the function $f(x) = x^3$. Its first and second derivative vanish for $x=0$. Optimization might stall at the point, even though it is not a minimum."

We will discuss some exceptions to this situation in the next section when introducing convexity. In short, convex functions are those where the eigenvalues of the Hessian are never negative. Sadly, though, most deep learning problems do not fall into this category. Nonetheless it's a great tool to study optimization algorithms. \n",

    "\n",
    "Probably the most insidious problem to encounter are vanishing gradients. For instance, assume that we want to minimize the function $f(x) = \\tanh(x)$ and we happen to get started at $x = 4$. As we can see, the gradient of $f$ is close to nil. More specifically $f'(x) = 1 - \\tanh^2(x)$ and thus $f'(4) = 0.0013$. Consequently optimization will get stuck for a long time before we make progress. This turns out to be one of the reasons that training deep learning models was quite tricky prior to the introduction of the ReLu activation function."
