    "In the [\"Gradient Descent and Stochastic Gradient Descent\"](./gd-sgd.md) section, we mentioned that the gradient of the objective function's independent variable represents the direction of the objective function's fastest descend at the current position of the independent variable. Therefore, gradient descent is also called steepest descent. In each iteration, the gradient descends according to the current position of the independent variable while updating the latter along the current position of the gradient. However, this can lead to problems if the iterative direction of the independent variable relies exclusively on the current position of the independent variable.\n",

In contrast to the [\"Gradient Descent and Stochastic Gradient Descent\"](./gd-sgd.md) section, here, the coefficient $x_1^2$ is reduced from $1$ to $0.1$. We are going to implement gradient descent based on this objective function, and demonstrate the iterative trajectory of the independent variable using the learning rate $0.4."

In other words, considering mini-batch SGD, the update of an independent variable with momentum at each time step approximates the EWMA of the updates in the last $1/(1-\\gamma)$ time steps without momentum, divided by $1-\\gamma$. Thus, with momentum, the movement size at each direction not only depends on the current gradient, but also depends on whether the past gradients are aligned at each direction. In the optimization problem mentioned earlier in this section, all the gradients are positive in the horizontal direction (rightward), but are occasionally positive (up) or negative (down) in the vertical direction. As a result, we can use a larger learning rate to allow the independent variable move faster towards the optimum.\n",
