    "# Adam\n",
    "\n",
    "Created on the basis of RMSProp, Adam also uses EWMA on the mini-batch stochastic gradient[1]. Here, we are going to introduce this algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Adam uses the momentum variable $\\boldsymbol{v}_t$ and variable $\\boldsymbol{s}_t$, which is an EWMA on the squares of elements in the mini-batch stochastic gradient from RMSProp, and initializes each element of the variables to 0 at time step 0. Given the hyperparameter $0 \\leq \\beta_1 < 1$ (the author of the algorithm suggests a value of 0.9), the momentum variable $\\boldsymbol{v}_t$ at time step $t$ is the EWMA of the mini-batch stochastic gradient $\\boldsymbol{g}_t$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\boldsymbol{v}_t \\leftarrow \\beta_1 \\boldsymbol{v}_{t-1} + (1 - \\beta_1) \\boldsymbol{g}_t. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as in RMSProp, given the hyperparameter $0 \\leq \\beta_2 < 1$ (the author of the algorithm suggests a value of 0.999),\n",
    "After taken the squares of elements in the mini-batch stochastic gradient, find $\\boldsymbol{g}_t \\odot \\boldsymbol{g}_t$ and perform EWMA on it to obtain $\\boldsymbol{s}_t$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\boldsymbol{s}_t \\leftarrow \\beta_2 \\boldsymbol{s}_{t-1} + (1 - \\beta_2) \\boldsymbol{g}_t \\odot \\boldsymbol{g}_t. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we initialized elements in $\\boldsymbol{v}_0$ and $\\boldsymbol{s}_0$ to 0,\n",
    "we get $\\boldsymbol{v}_t =  (1-\\beta_1) \\sum_{i=1}^t \\beta_1^{t-i} \\boldsymbol{g}_i$ at time step $t$. Sum the mini-batch stochastic gradient weights from each previous time step to get $(1-\\beta_1) \\sum_{i=1}^t \\beta_1^{t-i} = 1 - \\beta_1^t$. Notice that when $t$ is small, the sum of the mini-batch stochastic gradient weights from each previous time step will be small. For example, when $\\beta_1 = 0.9$, $\\boldsymbol{v}_1 = 0.1\\boldsymbol{g}_1$. To eliminate this effect, for any time step $t$, we can divide $\\boldsymbol{v}_t$ by $1 - \\beta_1^t$, so that the sum of the mini-batch stochastic gradient weights from each previous time step is 1. This is also called bias correction. In the Adam algorithm, we perform bias corrections for variables $\\boldsymbol{v}_t$ and $\\boldsymbol{s}_t$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{\\boldsymbol{v}}_t \\leftarrow \\frac{\\boldsymbol{v}_t}{1 - \\beta_1^t}, $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{\\boldsymbol{s}}_t \\leftarrow \\frac{\\boldsymbol{s}_t}{1 - \\beta_2^t}. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, the Adam algorithm will use the bias-corrected variables $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{v}}_t$ and $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{s}}_t$ from above to re-adjust the learning rate of each element in the model parameters using element operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\boldsymbol{g}_t' \\leftarrow \\frac{\\eta \\hat{\\boldsymbol{v}}_t}{\\sqrt{\\hat{\\boldsymbol{s}}_t + \\epsilon}},$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $eta$ is the learning rate while $\\epsilon$ is a constant added to maintain numerical stability, such as $10^{-8}$. Just as for Adagrad, RMSProp, and Adadelta, each element in the independent variable of the objective function has its own learning rate. Finally, use $\\boldsymbol{g}_t'$ to iterate the independent variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\boldsymbol{x}_t \\leftarrow \\boldsymbol{x}_{t-1} - \\boldsymbol{g}_t'. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation from Scratch\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the formula from the algorithm to implement Adam. Here, time step $t$ uses `hyperparams` to input parameters to the `adam` function."
