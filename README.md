# Notebooks

This repo is for hosting .ipynb notebooks in [d2l-en](https://github.com/d2l-ai/d2l-en). These notebooks are modified to run on cloud, such as Amazon Sagemaker and Google Colab. For example, you can allocate a free GPU instance and execute the notebook on Google colab by clicking the following link:

Note: please don't modify the contents in this repo except for README.md, which are automatically generated. 

Also this feature is still experimental, there are known bugs.
