    "# Semantic Segmentation and Data Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "In our discussion of object detection issues in the previous sections, we only used rectangular bounding boxes to label and predict objects in images. In this section, we will look at semantic segmentation, which attempts to segment images into regions with different semantic categories. These semantic regions label and predict objects at the pixel level. Figure 9.10 shows a semantically-segmented image, with areas labeled \"dog\", \"cat\", and \"background\". As you can see, compared to object detection, semantic segmentation labels areas with pixel-level borders, for significantly greater precision.\n",

    "## Image Segmentation and Instance Segmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "In the computer vision field, there are two important methods related to semantic segmentation: image segmentation and instance segmentation. Here, we will distinguish these concepts from semantic segmentation as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Image segmentation divides an image into several constituent regions. This method generally uses the correlations between pixels in an image. During training, labels are not needed for image pixels. However, during prediction, this method cannot ensure that the segmented regions have the semantics we want. If we input the image in 9.10, image segmentation might divide the dog into two regions, one covering the dog's mouth and eyes where black is the prominent color and the other covering the rest of the dog where yellow is the prominent color.\n",
    "* Instance segmentation is also called simultaneous detection and segmentation. This method attempts to identify the pixel-level regions of each object instance in an image. In contrast to semantic segmentation, instance segmentation not only distinguishes semantics, but also different object instances. If an image contains two dogs, instance segmentation will distinguish which pixels belong to which dog.\n",
