    "In anomaly detection, we might want to assess how *likely* a set of readings from an airplane's jet engine would be,\n",
    "were it operating normally.\n",
    "In reinforcement learning, we want an agent to act intelligently in an environment.\n",
    "This means we need to think about the probability of getting a high reward under each of the available action.\n",
    "And when we build recommender systems we also need to think about probability.\n",
    "For example, if we *hypothetically* worked for a large online bookseller,\n",
    "we might want to estimate the probability that a particular user would buy a particular book, if prompted.\n",
    "For this we need to use the language of probability and statistics.\n",

    "In other words, our ability to tell cats and dogs apart at a large distance (and thus low resolution)\n",
    "might approach uninformed guessing.\n",
    "Probability gives us a formal way of reasoning about our level of certainty.\n",
    "If we are completely sure that the image depicts a cat,\n",
    "we say that the *probability* that the corresponding label $l$ is $\\mathrm{cat}$,\n",
    "denoted $P(l=\\mathrm{cat})$ equals 1.0.\n",
    "If we had no evidence to suggest that $l =\\mathrm{cat}$ or that $l = \\mathrm{dog}$,\n",

    "expressing this as $P(l=\\mathrm{cat}) = 0.5$.\n",
    "If we were reasonably confident, but not sure that the image depicted a cat,\n",
    "we might assign a probability $.5  < P(l=\\mathrm{cat}) < 1.0$.\n",

    "given some weather monitoring data,\n",

    "After all, the first test was more accurate.\n",
    "The reason is that we needed a second test that confirmed *independently* of the first test that things were dire, indeed. In other words, we made the tacit assumption that $\\Pr(D_1, D_2 | H) = \\Pr(D_1 | H) \\Pr(D_2 | H)$. Statisticians call such random variables **conditionally independent**. This is expressed as $D_1 \\perp\\!\\!\\!\\perp D_2  | H$.\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we covered probabilities, independence, conditional independence, and how to use this to draw some basic conclusions. This is already quite powerful. In the next section we will see how this can be used to perform some basic estimation using a Naive Bayes classifier.\n",

    "## Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Given two events with probability $\\Pr(A)$ and $\\Pr(B)$, compute upper and lower bounds on $\\Pr(A \\cup B)$ and $\\Pr(A \\cap B)$. Hint - display the situation using a [Venn Diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venn_diagram).\n",
    "1. Assume that we have a sequence of events, say $A$, $B$ and $C$, where $B$ only depends on $A$ and $C$ only on $B$, can you simplify the joint probability? Hint - this is a [Markov Chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain).\n",
