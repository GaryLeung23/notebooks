That means there is (actually, should be, since this is not a *real* random number generator) no interval in which numbers are more likely than in any other. In other words, the chances of any of these numbers to fall into the interval, say $[0.2,0.3)$ are as high as in the interval $[.593264, .693264)$. The way they are generated internally is by producing a random integer first, and then dividing it by its maximum range. If we want to have integers directly, try the following instead. It generates random numbers between 0 and 100."

There are many tricks for sampling from it - the key idea in all algorithms is to stratify $p(x)$ in such a way as to map it to the uniform distribution $U[0,1]$. One way to do this is with the probability integral transform.\n",

Unlike previously where we needed to find the correct interval for the vector $F$ (i.e. for the piecewise constant function), we now invert the function $F(x)$.\n",

For now, suffice it to say that there are built-in algorithms to address this.\n",

To get some idea, let's repeat the experiment described in the beginning, but now using random variables with integer values of $\\{0, 1, 2\\}$."
